1.7.8 (November 14 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic &lt;sinisa@mysql.com&gt;</A>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Introduced a new, standard way of dealing with C++ exceptions. MySQL++
now supports two different methods of tracing exceptions. One is by
the fixed type (the old one) and one is standard C++ type by the usage
of what() method. A choice of methods has to be done in building a
library. If configure script is run with -enable-exception option
, then new method will be used. If no option is provided, or -disable-exception
is used, old MySQL++ exceptions will be enforced. This innovation
is a contribution of Mr. Ben Johnson &lt;ben@blarg.net&gt;
</LI>
<LI>MySQL++ now automatically reads at connection all standard MySQL configuration
files
</LI>
<LI>Fixed a bug in sql_query::parse to enable it to parse more then 99
char's
</LI>
<LI>Added an optional client flag in connect, which will enable usage
of this option, e.g. for getting matched and not just affected rows.
This change does not require any changes in existing programs
</LI>
<LI>Fixed some smaller bugs
</LI>
<LI>Added better handling of NULL's. Programmers will get a NULL string
in result set and should use is_null() method in ColData to check
if value is NULL
</LI>
<LI>Further improved configuration
</LI>
<LI>Updated documentation, including a Postscript format

</H1>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This release has mainl bug fixes&nbsp; and code improvements
</LI>
<LI>A bug in FieldNames::init has been fixed, enabling a bug free usage
of this class with in what ever a mixture of cases that is required
</LI>
<LI>Changed behaviour of ResUse, Result and Row classes, so that they
could be re-used as much as necessary, without any memory leaks, nor
with any re-initializations necessary
</LI>
<LI>Fixed all potential leaks that could have been caused by usage of
delete instead of delete[] after memory has been allocated with
new[]
</LI>
<LI>Deleted all unused classes and macros. This led to a reduction of
library size to one half of the original size. This has furthermore
brought improvements in compilation speed
</LI>
<LI>Moved all string manipulation from system libraries to libmysqlclient,
thus enabling uniformity of code and usage of 64 bit integers on all
platforms, including Windows, without reverting to conditional compilation.
This changes now requires usage of mysql 3.23 client libraries, as
mandatory
</LI>
<LI>Changed examples to reflect above changes
</LI>
<LI>Configuration scripts have been largely changed and further changes
shall appear in consecutive sub-releases. This changes have been done
and shall be done by our MySQL developer Thimble Smith &lt;tim@mysql.com&gt;
</LI>
<LI>Changed README, TODO and text version of manual. Other versions of
manual have not been updated
</LI>
<LI>Fixed .version ``bug''. This is only partially fixed and version remains
1.7.0 due to some problems in current versions of libtool. This shall
be finally fixed in a near future
</LI>
<LI>Several smaller fixes and improvements
</LI>
<LI>Added build.sh script to point to the correct procedure of building
of this library. Edit it to add configure options of your choice

</H1>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>This is mainly a release dealing with bug fixes, consistency improvements
and easier configure on some platforms
</LI>
<LI>A bug in fetch_row() method of ResUse class has been fixed. Beside
changes that existed in a distributed patch, some additional error
checking has been introduced
</LI>
<LI>A bug in escape manipulator has been fixed that could cause an error
if all characters had to be escaped
</LI>
<LI>An inconsistency in column indexing has been fixed. Before this version,
column names in row indexing with strings, i.e. row[&lt;string&gt;]
, has been case sensitive, which was inconsistent with MySQL server
handling of column names
</LI>
<LI>An inconsistency in conversion from strings to integers or floats
has been fixed. In prior version a space found in data would cause
a BadConversion exception. This has been fixed, but 100% consistency
with MySQL server has not been targeted, so that other non-numeric
characters in data will still cause BadConversion exception or error.
As this API is used in applications, users should provide feedback
if full compatibility with MySQL server is desired, in which case
BadConversion exception or error would be abolished in some of future
versions
</LI>
<LI>A new method in ColData class has been introduced. is_null() method
returns a boolean to denote if a column in a row is NULL. Finally,
as of this release, testing for NULL values is possible. Those are
columns with empty strings for which is_null() returns true.
</LI>
<LI>Some SPARC Solaris installations had C++ exception problems with g++
2.95.2 This was a bug that was fixed in GNU gcc, as from release 2.95
19990728. This version was thoroughly tested and is fully functional
on SPARC Solaris 2.6 with the above version of gcc.
</LI>
<LI>A 'virtual destructor ' warning for Result class has been fixed
</LI>
<LI>Several new functions for STL strings have been added. Those functions
(see string_util.hh) add some of the functionality missing in existing
STL libraries
</LI>
<LI>Conversion for 64 bit integers on FreeBSD systems has been added.
On those systems _FIX_FOR_BSD_ should be defined in CXXFLAGS prior
to configuring. Complete conversion to the usage of functions for
integer conversion found in mysqlclient library is planned for one
of the next releases
</LI>
<LI>A completely new, fully dynamic, dramatic and fully mutable result
set has been designed and will be implemented in some of 2.x releases
</LI>
<LI>Several smaller fixes and improvements, including defaulting exceptions
to true, instead of false, as of this version
</LI>
<LI>An up-to-date and complete Postscript version of documentation is
included in this distribution
</LI>
<LI>Large chunks of this manual are changed, as well as README and TODO
files.
</LI>

<UL>
<LI>This is a major release as it includes new features and major rewrites
</LI>
<LI>Automatic quoting and escaping with streams. It works automatically
, depending on the column type. It will work with <I>&lt;&lt;</I>
on all ostream derived types. it is paricularly handy with query objects
and strstreams. Automatic quoting and escaping on cout, cerr and clog
stream objects is intentionally left out, as quoting / escaping on
those stream objects is not necessary. This feature can be turned
of by setting global boolean dont_quote_auto to true.
</LI>
<LI>Made some major changes in code, so that now execute method should
be used only with SSQL and template queries, while for all other query
execution of UPDATE's, INSERT's, DELETE's, new method exec() should
be used. It is also faster.
</LI>
<LI>New method get_string is inroduced for easier handling / casting
ColData into C++ strings.
</LI>
<LI>Major rewrite of entire code, which led to it's reduction and speed
improvement. This also led to removal of several source files. 
</LI>
<LI>Handling of binary data is introduced. No application program changes
are required. One of new example programs demonstrates handling of
binary data
</LI>
<LI>Three new example programs have been written and thoroughly tested.
Their intention is to solve some problems addressed by MySQL users.
</LI>
<LI>Thorough changes is Makefile system has been made
</LI>
<LI>Better configuration scripts are written, thanks to D.Hawkins &lt;dhawkins@cdrgts.com&gt;

<LI>Major interface changes. I warned you that the interface may change
while it is in pre-alpha state and I wasn't kidding.

queries from the Mysql object instead you have to create a query object
with Mysql::query() and use it to execute queries.
</LI>

Fixed a few bugs in the MysqlDate... that effected the stream output
