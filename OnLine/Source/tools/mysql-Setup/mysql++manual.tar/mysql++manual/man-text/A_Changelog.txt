                                 A. Changelog
                                       
           1.7.9 (May 1 2001) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * Fixed a serious bug in Connection constructor when reading MySQL
       options
     * Improved copy constructor and some other methods in Result /
       ResUse
     * Many other minor improvements
     * Produced a complete manual with chapter 5 included
     * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format
       
        1.7.8 (November 14 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * Introduced a new, standard way of dealing with C++ exceptions.
       MySQL++ now supports two different methods of tracing exceptions.
       One is by the fixed type (the old one) and one is standard C++
       type by the usage of what() method. A choice of methods has to be
       done in building a library. If configure script is run with
       -enable-exception option , then new method will be used. If no
       option is provided, or -disable-exception is used, old MySQL++
       exceptions will be enforced. This innovation is a contribution of
       Mr. Ben Johnson <ben@blarg.net>
     * MySQL++ now automatically reads at connection all standard MySQL
       configuration files
     * Fixed a bug in sql_query::parse to enable it to parse more then 99
       char's
     * Added an optional client flag in connect, which will enable usage
       of this option, e.g. for getting matched and not just affected
       rows. This change does not require any changes in existing
       programs
     * Fixed some smaller bugs
     * Added better handling of NULL's. Programmers will get a NULL
       string in result set and should use is_null() method in ColData to
       check if value is NULL
     * Further improved configuration
     * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format
       
        1.7.6 (September 22 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * This release contains some C++ coherency improvements and scripts
       enhacements
     * result_id() is made available to programmers to fetch
       LAST_INSERT_ID() value
     * Connection constroctur ambiguity resolved, thanks to marc@mit.edu
     * Improved cnnfigure for better finding out MySQL libraries and
       includes
     * Updated documentation, including a Postscript format
       
          1.7.5 (July 30 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * This release has mainl bug fixes  and code improvements
     * A bug in FieldNames::init has been fixed, enabling a bug free
       usage of this class with in what ever a mixture of cases that is
       required
     * Changed behaviour of ResUse, Result and Row classes, so that they
       could be re-used as much as necessary, without any memory leaks,
       nor with any re-initializations necessary
     * Fixed all potential leaks that could have been caused by usage of
       delete instead of delete[] after memory has been allocated with
       new[]
     * Deleted all unused classes and macros. This led to a reduction of
       library size to one half of the original size. This has
       furthermore brought improvements in compilation speed
     * Moved all string manipulation from system libraries to
       libmysqlclient, thus enabling uniformity of code and usage of 64
       bit integers on all platforms, including Windows, without
       reverting to conditional compilation. This changes now requires
       usage of mysql 3.23 client libraries, as mandatory
     * Changed examples to reflect above changes
     * Configuration scripts have been largely changed and further
       changes shall appear in consecutive sub-releases. This changes
       have been done and shall be done by our MySQL developer Thimble
       Smith <tim@mysql.com>
     * Changed README, TODO and text version of manual. Other versions of
       manual have not been updated
     * Fixed .version ``bug''. This is only partially fixed and version
       remains 1.7.0 due to some problems in current versions of libtool.
       This shall be finally fixed in a near future
     * Several smaller fixes and improvements
     * Added build.sh script to point to the correct procedure of
       building of this library. Edit it to add configure options of your
       choice
       
            1.7 (May17 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * This is mainly a release dealing with bug fixes, consistency
       improvements and easier configure on some platforms
     * A bug in fetch_row() method of ResUse class has been fixed. Beside
       changes that existed in a distributed patch, some additional error
       checking has been introduced
     * A bug in escape manipulator has been fixed that could cause an
       error if all characters had to be escaped
     * An inconsistency in column indexing has been fixed. Before this
       version, column names in row indexing with strings, i.e.
       row[<string>] , has been case sensitive, which was inconsistent
       with MySQL server handling of column names
     * An inconsistency in conversion from strings to integers or floats
       has been fixed. In prior version a space found in data would cause
       a BadConversion exception. This has been fixed, but 100%
       consistency with MySQL server has not been targeted, so that other
       non-numeric characters in data will still cause BadConversion
       exception or error. As this API is used in applications, users
       should provide feedback if full compatibility with MySQL server is
       desired, in which case BadConversion exception or error would be
       abolished in some of future versions
     * A new method in ColData class has been introduced. is_null()
       method returns a boolean to denote if a column in a row is NULL.
       Finally, as of this release, testing for NULL values is possible.
       Those are columns with empty strings for which is_null() returns
       true.
     * Some SPARC Solaris installations had C++ exception problems with
       g++ 2.95.2 This was a bug that was fixed in GNU gcc, as from
       release 2.95 19990728. This version was thoroughly tested and is
       fully functional on SPARC Solaris 2.6 with the above version of
       gcc.
     * A 'virtual destructor ' warning for Result class has been fixed
     * Several new functions for STL strings have been added. Those
       functions (see string_util.hh) add some of the functionality
       missing in existing STL libraries
     * Conversion for 64 bit integers on FreeBSD systems has been added.
       On those systems _FIX_FOR_BSD_ should be defined in CXXFLAGS prior
       to configuring. Complete conversion to the usage of functions for
       integer conversion found in mysqlclient library is planned for one
       of the next releases
     * A completely new, fully dynamic, dramatic and fully mutable result
       set has been designed and will be implemented in some of 2.x
       releases
     * Several smaller fixes and improvements, including defaulting
       exceptions to true, instead of false, as of this version
     * An up-to-date and complete Postscript version of documentation is
       included in this distribution
     * Large chunks of this manual are changed, as well as README and
       TODO files.
       
            1.6 (Feb 3 2000) Sinisa Milivojevic <sinisa@mysql.com>
                                       
     * This is a major release as it includes new features and major
       rewrites
     * Automatic quoting and escaping with streams. It works
       automatically , depending on the column type. It will work with <<
       on all ostream derived types. it is paricularly handy with query
       objects and strstreams. Automatic quoting and escaping on cout,
       cerr and clog stream objects is intentionally left out, as quoting
       / escaping on those stream objects is not necessary. This feature
       can be turned of by setting global boolean dont_quote_auto to
       true.
     * Made some major changes in code, so that now execute method should
       be used only with SSQL and template queries, while for all other
       query execution of UPDATE's, INSERT's, DELETE's, new method exec()
       should be used. It is also faster.
     * New method get_string is inroduced for easier handling / casting
       ColData into C++ strings.
     * Major rewrite of entire code, which led to it's reduction and
       speed improvement. This also led to removal of several source
       files.
     * Handling of binary data is introduced. No application program
       changes are required. One of new example programs demonstrates
       handling of binary data
     * Three new example programs have been written and thoroughly
       tested. Their intention is to solve some problems addressed by
       MySQL users.
     * Thorough changes is Makefile system has been made
     * Better configuration scripts are written, thanks to D.Hawkins
       <dhawkins@cdrgts.com>
     * Added several bug fixes
     * Changed Manual and Changelog

     * Added automake and autoconf support by loic@ceic.com
     * Added Makefile for manual
     * Added support for cygwin
     * Added example sinisa_ex (let modesty prevail) which used to crash
       a lot when memory allocation, memory leak and overlap problems
       were present. Smooth running of this example proves that all those
       bugs are fixed
     * Corrected bugs in sql_query.cc regarding delete versus delete[]
       and string length in manip.cc
     * Changed manual

     * Added patches from Orion Poplawski <orion@bvt.com> to support the
       UnixWare 7.0 compiler
       
                            .64.1.1a (Sep 27 1998)
                                       
     * Fixed several bugs that caused my library to fail to compile with
       egcs 1.1. Hopefully it will still compile with egcs 1.0 however I
       have not been able to test it with egcs 1.0.
     * Removed some problem causing debug output in sql++pretty.
       
                              .64.1a (Aug 1 1998)
                                       
     * Added an (almost) full guide to using Template Queries.
     * Fixed it so the SQLQuery will throw an exception when all the
       template parameters are not provided.
     * Proofread and speedchecked the manual (it really needed it).
     * Other minor document fixes.
       
                            .64.0.1a (July 31 1998)
                                       
     * Reworked the Class Reference section a bit.
     * Minor document fixes
     * Added more examples for SSQLS.
     * Changed the syntax of equal_list for SSQLS from equal_list (cchar
       *, Manip, cchar *) to (cchar *, cchar *, Manip).
     * Added set methods to SSQLS. These new methods do the same thing as
       there corresponding constructors.
     * Added methods for creating a mysql_type_info from a C++ type_info.
       
                             .64.a (July 24 1998)
                                       
     * Changed the names of all the classes so they no longer have to
       have Mysql in the begging of it. However if this creates a problem
       you can define a macro to only use the old names instead.
     * The Specialized SQL Structures (formally known as Custom Mysql
       Structures) changed from mysql_ to sql_.
     * Added the option of using exceptions thoughout the API.
     * ColData (formally known as MysqlStrings) will now throw an
       exception if there is a problem in the conversion.
     * Added a null adapter.
     * Added Mutable Result Sets
     * Added a very basic runtime type identification for SQL types
     * Changed the document format from POD to LYX .
     * Am now using a modified version of Perceps to extract the class
       information directly from the code to make my life easier.
     * Added an option of defining a macro to avoid using the automatic
       conversion with binary operators.
     * Other small fixed I probully forgot to mentune.
       
                                    .63.1.a
                                       
     * Added Custom Mysql Structures.
     * Fixed the Copy constructor of class Mysql
     * Started adding code so that class Mysql lets it children now when
       it is leaving
     * Attempted to compile it into a library but still need help. As
       default it will compile as a regular program.
     * Other small fixes.
       
                              .62.a (May 3 1998)
                                       
     * Added Template Queries
     * Created s separate SQLQuery object that is independent of an SQL
       connection.
     * You no longer have to import the data for the test program as the
       program creates the database and tables it needs.
     * Many small bug fixes.
       
                            .61.1.a (April 28 1998)
                                       
     * Cleaned up the example code in test.cc and included it in the
       manual.
     * Added an interface layout plan to the manual.
     * Added a reverse iterator.
     * Fixed a bug with row.hh (It wasn't being included because of a
       typo).
       
                                    .61.0.a
                                       
     * Major interface changes. I warned you that the interface may
       change while it is in pre-alpha state and I wasn't kidding.
     * Created a new and Separate Query Object. You can no longer execute
       queries from the Mysql object instead you have to create a query
       object with Mysql::query() and use it to execute queries.
     * Added the comparison operators to MysqlDate, MysqlTime and
       MysqlDateTime. Fixed a few bugs in the MysqlDate... that effected
       the stream output and the conversion of them to strings.
     * Reflected the MysqlDate... changes in the manual.
     * Added a new MysqlSet object and a bunch of functions for working
       with mysql set strings.
       
                            .60.3a (April 24 1998)
                                       
     * Changed strtoq and strtouq to strtoll and strtull for metter
       compatibility Minor Manual fix.
     * Changed makefile to make it more compatible with Solaris (Thanks
       Chris H)
     * Fixed bug in comparison functions so that they would compare in he
       right direction.
     * Added some items to the to do list be sure to have a look.
