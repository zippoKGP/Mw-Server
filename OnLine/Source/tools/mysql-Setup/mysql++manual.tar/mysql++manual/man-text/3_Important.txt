                             3. Important Changes
                                       
                              3.1 Current Changes
                                       
     * Changed the syntax of equal_list for SSQLS from equal_list (cchar
       *, Manip, cchar *) to equal_list (cchar *, cchar *, Manip).
     * Since version 1.3 of mysql++, it can no longer be compiled and
       built by GNU compilers older then 2.95. Since version 1.3, mysql++
       has been changed to accomodate changes in 2.95 on various aspects
       of C++. This prevents it's building with earlier versions of GNU ,
       like 2.7.xx, 2.8.xx. Also building by egcs compilers 1.x.x is not
       supported any more. Although with some changes in code mysql++
       could be built with earlier compilers, running of such programs
       would result in their crashing.
     * At the writting of the present version (1.7.9) g++ 2.95.3 and g++
       2.96 can not be used either
     * There are separate versions for Borland C++, VC++ and Compaq
       compilers on Tru64
     * It was also noted that on certain SPARC Solaris installation, C++
       exceptions did not work with gcc 2.95.2. This case was tested and
       it is established that mysql++ builds and runs flawlessly with a
       following version of gcc on Solaris: gcc version 2.95 19990728
       (release)
     * The ``connection'' constructors for Connection and
       Connection::connect (formally known as Mysql) has changed so that
       the data base name is the first paremeter. The same is valid for
       connect method.
     * All new client feature implemented in 3.22.xx as various options
       on connect are mplemented in a new constructor and real_connect
       method
     * Also new configuration constructs in 3.23.xx are strictly followed
     * Mysql++ now can be compiled on Win32 with use of Cygwin compiler
       from Cygnus Inc.
     * Autoconf and Automake are fully implemented
     * The Specialized SQL Structures (formally known as Custom Mysql
       Structures) changed from mysql_ to sql_.
     * Changed all of the functions that return zero (false) on success
       and non-zero (true) other wise to bool. This means that they now
       return true on success and false on faillier. This means that you
       now need to negate your expressions that test the output of these
       functions.
     * Almost all methods that returned MysqlString now return a normal
       string. Because MysqlString objects will convert them selves into
       string when needed there should not be a problem with:
        MysqlString s = mysql.host_info
     * The data type MysqlRow now returns (MysqlString or MysqlColData)
       is now subclassed from a special string class that we wrote to
       handle working with a const string in a much more efficient way
       (ie it doesn't copy it). Unfortunitlly this data type is also more
       limited see the section on "const_string" for more info.
     * All necessary methods pertaining to the administration funcitons
       have been added
     * Mysql++ now quotes and escapes objects automatically, if column
       data is used with '<<' operator
     * Mysql++ now has much more secure execution of INSERT, UPDATE and
       DELETE with a new exec() method
     * Mysql++ now has much better configuration
     * There is a new method of fetching strings
     * Mysql++ can now work with binary data
     * Standard C++ exceptions handling with what() method has been
       introduced
     * All 64 int handling of string conversions have been moved to
       libmysqlclient
     * Programs written with MySQL++ will now automatically read all
       relevant MySQL configuration files
       
                              3.2 Future Changes
                                       
     * To implement fully mutable result sets
     * The behavior of MysqlString when used with binary operators is
       going to change in a future version (if we can figure out how to
       pull it off) Instead of converting to the type on the other side
       of the operator the MysqlString will it convert to the type the
       Mysql server said it originally was. This will be a lot safer and
       more predictable.
