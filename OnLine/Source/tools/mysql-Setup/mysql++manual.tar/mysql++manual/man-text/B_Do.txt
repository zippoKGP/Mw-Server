                                   B. To Do
                                       
   These are in the order I plan on implementing them.
   
     * Improve the runtime type identification system for the sql types
       which will be needed for the mutable results sets and the binary
       operators in particular.
     * To move properly all 64 int handling to libmysqlclient
     * To implement dynamic, fully mutable result sets
     * To improve configure for better detection of mysql includes and
       libs
     * Improve the mutable results sets so that they can be assigned
       types that are not strings setting the sql type aproprestly. Also
       allow the SQLtype to be fixed so that when the programmer assigned
       a type to the data field that is not compatible with that sql type
       it will through an exception. For example setting an string to an
       int.
     * Change the behavior of MysqlString when used with binary
       operators. Instead of converting to the type on the other side of
       the operator have it convert to the type the Mysql server said it
       originally was.
     * Improve the Null adapters to make them more intelligently.
     * Be able to store the result set in an assignable container that
       stores the results in the format they were originally stored in on
       the server. (Not sure what the best way to go about this is. If
       you have any ideas let me know.)
     * Better handling of the destruction of the Mysql class. Have it
       first tell all its children that its parent is getting destroys
       and have then respond appropreatly. (Partly implemented as of
       version .63.1.a)
     * Create a container to hold Mysql enums and sets as a bit set as
       opposed to a list of STL set.
       
   If you have anything else you want to see let us know at
   sinisa@mysql.com or monty@mysql.com.
